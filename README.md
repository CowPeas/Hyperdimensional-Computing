# Hyperdimensional-Computing

This is a playground for the learning of hyperdimensional computing.

Hyper-dimensional computing involves processing information in higher-dimensional spaces than the traditional two- or three-dimensional spaces used in most computing systems. The main idea behind the paradigm is that higher-dimensional spaces can provide a more efficient and powerful way to represent and process complex data.
